# Boundary conditions for the 1D ADM scalar wave (`wave1d_curved_rhs!`).
#
# Design goal: the package is a testbed for the Einstein equations, so
# the *radiative* boundary conditions deliberately avoid characteristic
# **eigenvector** projection (which is cheap here but expensive and
# gauge-dependent for multi-field GR systems). Only characteristic
# **speeds** (eigenvalues) are used — for inflow/outflow classification
# and for the penalty magnitude — which is unavoidable for any open
# boundary and far simpler than eigenvectors.
#
# Characteristic speeds. The principal system in (∂_xΦ, Π) has flux
# matrix A = [β a; a β] (a = α/√γ) with propagation speeds (dx/dt)
# s_R = a − β (rightward) and s_L = −a − β (leftward). A mode is
# *outgoing* at a face with outward normal n̂ iff s·n̂ > 0. These
# speeds classify a face:
#   * SUBLUMINAL (|β| < a; one mode in, one out):  radiative
#     (Sommerfeld) or Dirichlet data injection — see below.
#   * OUTFLOW (superluminal, both modes leave):    excision — no
#     boundary term; the one-sided `apply_D!` rows are already correct.
#   * INFLOW (superluminal, both modes enter):     full-state
#     Dirichlet — both Φ and Π pinned to data (no characteristics).
#   * SONIC (|β| ≈ a at the face):                 error; a vanishing
#     speed leaves a mode undetermined.
#
# Field-radiation SAT (subluminal faces). Rather than projecting onto
# the eigenvector ∂_xΦ ∓ Π, impose the scalar radiation condition on
# the FIELD,
#     ∂_tΦ + a·n̂·∂_xΦ = (data rate),
# rewritten with the evolution equation ∂_tΦ = β∂_xΦ + aΠ and divided
# by a into the normalised residual
#     r := Π + (n̂ + β/a)·∂_xΦ.
# At β = 0, r is exactly the incoming characteristic, so the penalty
# coincides with the textbook Sommerfeld SAT; for β ≠ 0 it differs by
# O(β)·∂_xΦ — a perturbation of the proven operator, stable for the
# small shift (|β| ≲ 0.1) radiative BCs are intended for. This is the
# NR-standard "apply ∂_t f + ∂_r f = 0 to each field" outer condition,
# and it ports field-by-field to Einstein with no eigendecomposition.
# Sommerfeld drives r → 0 (absorbing); Dirichlet drives r → its value
# on the boundary data (incoming wave injected, outgoing wave free).
#
# Energy. For E = ½∫[(Π/√γ)² + (∂_xΦ)²/γ]√γ dx the boundary terms are
# dE/dt = −¼ Σ_faces Σ_modes (s·n̂)·u² (up to the a/√γ weights):
# outgoing modes drain energy, the radiative penalty controls the
# ingoing injection. The penalties act on Π̇ at the single boundary
# node with strength σ·|s_in|/Hphys_face, |s_in| = a + n̂·β; σ = 1 was
# confirmed by the dense-operator spectrum tests (max Re(λ) ≤ round-off
# for every admissible subluminal configuration; σ = 1/2 is marginally
# unstable because the one-sided bulk operator leaves the full boundary
# flux for the penalty to cancel).
#
# Known limitation (genuine physics, not a SAT defect): with strongly
# space-varying *superluminal* β on an open domain the operator has
# eigenvalues with Re(λ) > 0 approaching the continuum bound
# max|∂_xβ| from below (compression amplification; present already
# with pure excision and no penalties, and absent on periodic meshes
# where modes recirculate through the exactly-skew operator). KO does
# not help — the growing mode is smooth. The tests assert
# max Re(λ) ≤ max|∂_xβ| for this regime.

Assemble the scalar boundary-condition bundle consumed by
[`wave1d_curved_rhs!`](@ref) (kwarg `bc1d`). `kindL`/`kindR` are
`BC_*` codes (or Symbols) for the −x / +x faces. Data slots per face:

* `BC_SOMMERFELD`:     radiative (absorbing). `g1` = 0 drives the
                       field-radiation residual `r = Π + (n̂+β/a)∂_xΦ`
                       to zero — no incoming wave. Characteristic-free
                       (no eigenvector projection); valid for small
                       shift (|β| ≲ 0.1).
* `BC_DIRICHLET`:      data injection through the *same* field-
                       radiation operator: `g1` = `r` evaluated on the
                       boundary data (e.g. an exact solution), so the
                       prescribed incoming wave enters while outgoing
                       waves leave. `g2` unused. (Only differs from
                       `BC_SOMMERFELD` by the nonzero target `g1`.)
* `BC_EXCISION`:       no data.
* `BC_FULL_DIRICHLET`: `g1` = Φ data, `g2` = Π data (superluminal
                       inflow — both modes enter, so the full state is
                       pinned; no characteristics).

All entries are plain scalars — assemble a fresh bundle at every
integrator stage time. σ is the penalty strength; σ = 1 (full upwind
weight) makes the subluminal operators exactly non-growing (spectrum
at round-off) at β = 0, while σ = 1/2 is marginally unstable — the
one-sided bulk operator leaves the *full* boundary flux for the
penalty to cancel. Verified by the dense-operator spectrum tests.
