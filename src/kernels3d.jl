#
# Element shape enters only through the per-node Jacobian carried by the
# `MeshGeometry`. The kernel applies the same machinery to axis-aligned
# cubes (where the Jacobian is a constant diagonal) and to curved hex
# elements (where the Jacobian varies per node and may be dense).
#
# Per-element structure
# ---------------------
# For each element `e`, the kernel computes `(L u)|_e` where `L` is the
# discrete physical Laplacian:
#
#   1. **Reference-axis gradients.** Compute `∂_a u[i,j,k]` for `a = 1,2,3`
#      via three 1D `G`-sweeps along each reference axis.
#
#   2. **Weak stiffness flux.** At each node, form
#         W_a[i,j,k] = H_ref[i] H_ref[j] H_ref[k] · |det J| ·
#                        Σ_b (J⁻¹ J⁻ᵀ)_{ab} · ∂_b u.
#      The contravariant metric `J⁻¹ J⁻ᵀ` couples reference axes
#      whenever `J` is non-diagonal (curvilinear elements).
#
#   3. **Weak volume term.** Apply `-Gᵀ` along each reference axis to
#      `W_a` and sum into `(H_phys · L u)`. This is the volume part of
#      the SBP-DG weak Laplacian; for axis-aligned cubes it reduces to
#      `(1/h²) · (−H⁻¹ Gᵀ H G) u` along each axis.
#
#   4. **Per-face SBP-SAT terms** (six faces per element). At every face
#      quadrature node, the kernel:
#         (a) builds the two tangent vectors as columns of `J` and takes
#             their cross product → physical outward normal `n_phys` and
#             surface element `|J_F|`;
#         (b) forms `μ = J⁻¹ · n_phys` (per-face-node 3-vector);
#         (c) evaluates the physical normal gradient
#                ∇u · n_phys = Σ_c μ_c · ∂_c u
#             on both the self and (when interior) neighbour sides;
#         (d) adds, with face quadrature weight `w_F = |J_F| · H_face`,
#                + w_F · (∇u · n_phys)_self            ← boundary lift
#                − (1/2) · w_F · Δ(∇u · n_phys)        ← adjoint consistency
#                − τ · w_F · Δu                        ← penalty
#             to the face node, and the symmetric SIPG lift
#                + α · w_F · Δu  ·  Σ_c μ_c · Gᵀ_c
#             distributed via three reference-axis `Gᵀ` lifts. For
#             axis-aligned cubes only `μ_a` (the orthogonal axis) is
#             non-zero, so this collapses to the existing single-axis
#             lift used in earlier code.
#
#   5. **Mass division.** Divide the accumulated `H_phys · L u` by the
#      per-node physical mass `H_phys = H_ref · |det J|` to recover
#      `L u` in physical units.

    Params3d{T}

Bundle of system-level scalar parameters for the 3D wave equation:

* `A` — IC amplitude.
* `k :: NTuple{3, T}` — IC wavenumber vector `(kx, ky, kz)`.
* `ω` — IC angular frequency.
* `τ` — SIPG penalty constant for `rhs3d!`.
* `bdry_values :: NTuple{6, T}` — per-face Dirichlet values, indexed
  by the boundary-condition tag stored on each outer face
  (`mesh.bdry[f, e]`).

These are exactly the mesh-independent scalars that the driver assembles
once and feeds to the IC setup and the RHS. Bundling them lets us pass
the whole bundle as the `p` argument of a `SecondOrderODEProblem` and
dispatch on `f!(ü, u̇, u, p::Params3d, t)` instead of capturing globals.

#
# For face `f`, the orthogonal reference axis is `a = (f+1) ÷ 2`. The two
# in-face tangent reference axes `(axis_p, axis_q)` are picked so that the
# face quadrature node index `(p, q)` maps naturally to the volume nodes:
#
#   a = 1 → (axis_p, axis_q) = (2, 3),  volume node = (face_row, p, q)
#   a = 2 → (axis_p, axis_q) = (1, 3),  volume node = (p, face_row, q)
#   a = 3 → (axis_p, axis_q) = (1, 2),  volume node = (p, q, face_row)
#
# `face_row = 1` on a −face, `N` on a +face. The natural cross product
# `t_axis_p × t_axis_q` equals `+ê_a` for `a ∈ {1,3}` and `−ê_a` for
# `a = 2`; the kernel multiplies by `cross_sign · face_sign` so the
# resulting vector points outward from the element.

# Per-kernel small-integer indexes are `Int32` throughout. NVIDIA GPUs
# emulate `Int64` arithmetic as pairs of 32-bit ops (≈4× slower per
# multiply on register-bound code), and Apple Silicon GPUs are

# intentional exception — meshes might (eventually) exceed 2³¹

# Face-trace gather (pass 1) + per-face SAT (pass 2)
#
# The kernel is split into two launches that share an element-indexed
# global staging buffer `geom.face_trace`. This converts the face-SAT's
# scattered neighbour reads (`u_global[..., nbr]` repeated for every
# face quadrature node and every stencil component) into a single
# coalesced load of `4·N²` floats per face per element. The two
# passes are:
#
#   Pass 1 (volume + trace): compute reference gradients `Du`,
#     weak stiffness flux `W`, and write the volume divergence to
#     `ü` (before mass division). Additionally, for each of the
#     element's six faces, gather the trace data — the scalar field
#     `u` and the **physical** gradient `∇u = J⁻ᵀ · Du` — into
#     `face_trace[1:4, p, q, f, e]`. We store the physical gradient
#     rather than the reference one so that pass 2 doesn't need to
#     read the neighbour's `geom.invjac` to reconstruct it.
#
#   Pass 2 (face SAT + mass div): add the four face SAT terms to
#     `ü`, reading self's data from `face_trace[..., self_face, e]`
#     and the neighbour's from `face_trace[..., nbr_face, nbr]`.
#     The only indirected read is the neighbour index per face — six
#     pointer fetches per element — and the actual face data is
#     contiguous in `face_trace`. Finally divide by `Hphys` per node.
#
# KA's command queue is FIFO per backend, so launching pass 2 after
# pass 1 guarantees pass 2 sees the trace data pass 1 wrote, without
# an explicit `synchronize`.

# Pass 2 face-SAT helpers.
#
# Pass 2 is workgroup-per-element: each workgroup has N³ workitems
# (one per collocation node) and shares a small `face_buf` in
# `@localmem` for one face at a time. For each of the six faces we
# run two phases separated by `@synchronize`:
#
#   1. *Compute* (`_face_sat_compute!`): only the N² workitems
#      whose `(i, j, k)` lies on the face are active. Each one
#      computes its face-node's SAT contributions and packs them into
#      `face_buf[1..4, p_local, q_local]`:
#         slot 1 — `bcorr = wF · (Gn_self − ½ ΔGn − τ Δu/h_F)`,
#                  the boundary lift + adjoint + penalty correction;
#         slot 2 — `μ_a · ν`, the weight for the "interior" SIPG lift
#                  along the face's orthogonal axis `a`;
#         slot 3 — `μ_axis_p · ν`, for the in-face lift along axis_p;
#         slot 4 — `μ_axis_q · ν`, for the in-face lift along axis_q.
#      Off-face workitems return without writing anything.
#
#   2. *Apply* (`_face_sat_apply!`): every workitem reads its
#      contribution from `face_buf` and updates its own
#      `üe_loc[i, j, k]`. The "interior" lift hits every workitem;
#      the two "in-face" lifts and the `bcorr` only hit workitems
#      that are themselves on the face (`ia == face_r`).
#
# The gather formulation eliminates all the scatter writes the old
# one-workitem-per-element pass 2 used to do — the SIPG lift's
# `üe[l, j, k] += G[i, l]·μ·ν` was a write race waiting to happen on
# any parallelization across face nodes. Here each workitem only
# writes `üe_loc[i, j, k]` (its own slot), so no atomics are needed.

# Global RHS

"""
    rhs3d!(ü, u, u̇, bdry_values; geom, ops, τ)

Curvilinear-aware 3D RHS over the mesh carried by `geom :: MeshGeometry`.
State arrays are 4-D, shape `(N, N, N, Ne)`, with element ordering
matching `geom`. The 6-tuple `bdry_values` is indexed by the
boundary-condition tag stored on each outer face (`mesh.bdry[f, e]`).

The kernel assumes a **diagonal** 1D mass matrix (`ops.H` is the GLL
quadrature). For dense-`H` branches (e.g. the Rational/Vandermonde
operator construction) the weak-form assembly would need a different
implementation.

# Choosing τ (SIPG penalty constant)

`τ` must be large enough to make the discrete Laplacian negative
semi-definite. Empirical rules of thumb (N = 5 GLL nodes per element):

* **Axis-aligned cubical mesh**: `τ ≈ 1.5·(N−1)² = 24` is sufficient.
* **Curvilinear / multi-patch mesh** (e.g. `make_cubed_cube_mesh`):
  the SIPG threshold rises significantly because the outer-patch
  elements are anisotropic and skewed. Use `τ ≈ 8·(N−1)² = 128` (for
  N=5). The threshold at which the operator first becomes NSD is around
  `4·(N−1)² ≈ 64`, but staying close to that edge can leave a handful
  of slowly-growing modes which compound over long integrations; the
  extra margin keeps the spectrum cleanly negative. Increasing `τ`
  further is harmless apart from a tighter CFL — use
  [`recommended_dt`](@ref) to size `dt` automatically.

If the operator's spectrum has positive eigenvalues, evolution will
slowly grow even with a symplectic integrator; you can verify
coercivity for any (geom, ops, τ) tuple via [`discrete_laplacian`](@ref)
on a small representative mesh.

# ---------- Kernel 1: face-trace gather ------------------------------
#
# Reads `u` and writes `geom.face_trace[1..4, p, q, f, e]`, the four
# scalars `(u, ∂x u, ∂y u, ∂z u)` at each face quadrature node of
# every element. This is the only data each element needs to ship to
# its neighbours.
#
# Workgroup-per-element, N³ workitems/workgroup, one per node. The
# workgroup loads `u` into `@localmem u_loc` so the SBP stencils that
# compute `∇_ref u` at the face nodes can read across workitems.
# Each workitem then checks the six boundary conditions on its
# `(i, j, k)`; for every face it lies on, it computes
# `∇u_phys = J⁻ᵀ · ∇_ref u` and writes one entry of `face_trace`. A
# corner workitem (on three faces) writes three entries; interior
# workitems (off every face) compute nothing — at N=4 that's the
# central 2×2×2 = 8 of the 64 workitems.
#
# We deliberately *do not* compute the volume divergence here: kernel
# 2 below recomputes the gradient from the same `u`. The redundancy
# (one extra global-memory `u` load + one extra stencil per element)
# is small relative to the work saved by not having to round-trip
# `Du_loc` or `ü_pre` through global memory between kernels.

# ---------- Kernel 2: volume work + face SAT + mass division --------
#
# Reads `u` (again) and `geom.face_trace` (written by kernel 1) and
# computes the full right-hand side `ü`. The phases inside the
# workgroup are:
#
#   1. Load u → u_loc. @synchronize.
#   2. Compute reference gradients (registers) + weak stiffness flux
#      W_loc (shared) at each node. @synchronize.
#   3. Volume divergence `−Σ_a Gᵀ_a W_a` → üe_loc (shared, pre-mass-
#      div). No barrier needed before face SAT because the divergence
#      writes only `üe_loc[i, j, k]` (the workitem's own slot) and
#      face SAT only reads it from the same slot.
#   4. Six face SAT phases. For each face:
#        a. `_face_sat_compute!` — on-face workitems pack the four
#           SAT scalars (`bcorr`, `μ_a·ν`, `μ_axis_p·ν`,
#           `μ_axis_q·ν`) into `face_buf`. Off-face workitems return.
#        @synchronize so all workitems see the freshly-written
#        `face_buf`.
#        b. `_face_sat_apply!` — every workitem adds its share to
#           `üe_loc[i, j, k]`. The "interior" lift hits everyone; the
#           in-face lifts + boundary correction only fire when the
#           workitem itself is on the face.
#        @synchronize so `face_buf` is safe to overwrite for the
#        next face.
#   5. Mass division + writeback. Each workitem divides its own
#      `üe_loc[i, j, k]` by `Hphys` and writes the result to `ü`.
#
# 12 barriers total inside the face SAT (2 per face), plus the 2
# inside the volume phase. Each barrier is ~ns on CUDA/Metal so the
# absolute cost is negligible at production scale.

Assemble the curvilinear discrete Laplacian `L_h` as an explicit sparse
matrix by repeatedly calling `rhs3d!` on each canonical basis vector.
The result `L_h` is the matrix that maps the linearly-indexed global
state vector `vec(u)` to `vec(rhs3d!(u))` (with `u̇ = 0` and zero
boundary data, so only the linear part of the homogeneous Laplacian
is captured).

Intended for analysis — eigenvalues, symmetry, condition number — not
for production timestepping. Cost is `O(N⁶ · Ne²)` element operations,
i.e. one `rhs3d!` call per degree of freedom.

**Host-only.** The per-column basis-vector trick uses scalar indexing
on a flat host vector; if `geom` is device-resident, migrate it back
with a fresh `make_geometry(mesh, elem)` first.

The per-node physical mass `H_phys` (which makes `H_phys · L_h` the
symmetric "stiffness" matrix) is available as
[`physical_mass_diagonal`](@ref).

# Keyword arguments

* `bdry_values` — passed straight through to `rhs3d!`; defaults to zero
  Dirichlet on every outer-face tag.
* `drop_tol` — entries with `abs(v) ≤ drop_tol` are not stored. Default
  `0` keeps every numerically computed value.

Estimate `|λ_max|`, the magnitude of the largest eigenvalue of the
curvilinear discrete Laplacian, via power iteration. For the negative
semi-definite wave-equation operator this equals `|λ_min| = ω_max²`,

Suggest a stable timestep for an explicit symplectic integrator
(`KahanLi8` and friends) on the wave equation `ü = L u`. Returns

The bare condition `dt · ω_max < 2` is the Störmer–Verlet stability
limit; `cfl_safety = 0.9` keeps a margin away from the edge.

Typical usage at the top of a driver:

it recovers the continuous `L²(Ω)` inner product in the high-resolution
